# Tambo Studio

Hackathon-style, demo-first “Lovable / Retool” experience for building AI-native apps.

This repo intentionally keeps everything frontend-only and mocked:

- Bootstrap chat maps keywords → a template + generated config
- Sidebar lets you toggle components and MCP servers and edit the system prompt
- Live preview renders UI components from the current config
- Generated config panel shows a read-only JSON artifact

## Dev

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

## Build

```bash
bun run build
```
